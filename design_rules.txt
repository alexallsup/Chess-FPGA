Piece codes:
	-Each piece shall be represented by four bits
	-The MSB (3) shall denote the color:
		White 	0
		Black	1
	-The LSBs (2:0) shall denote the type:
		No piece 	000	(used to show empty space)
		Pawn		001
		Knight		010
		Bishop		011
		Rook		100
		Queen		101
		King		110

Board addresses:
	-A 6-bit address defines the locations on the board
	-The MSB (5:3) will denote the row (rank). 
		-The top row (closest to black) will be 000
		-The bottom row (closest to white) will be 111
	-The LSB (2:0) will denote the column (file).
		-The leftmost column (from white's perspective) will be 000
		-The rightmost column will be 111
	-Trick to determine color: if bit 3 XOR bit 0 = 0, the square is WHITE
							   if bit 3 XOR bit 0 = 1, the square is BLACK
